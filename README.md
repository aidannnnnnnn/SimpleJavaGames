# SimpleJavaGames

Welcome to this simple Java Game repository. Within this repository, I utilise my skills in Java to create a quick, simple and easy text based/Command Line Interface game center, where the user is given the option to play numerous text based games. 

# Files
- **GameLauncher.java -** this is the home page, the user is asked to either quit the game or select a valid game mode (if an invalid input is entered, the game keeps asking for input until a valid input is received). Upon valid input, the respective command is executed (that is, a game is run or the program is ended)
- **TicTacToeVsComputer.java -** this is the code for a simple tic-tac-toe game against the AI, following the basic tic tac toe (X and O) rules. 

# Playing the game
To play the game, simply download the repository and ensure that you are in the SimpleJavaGames folder. You can navigate this by navigating using the following command: 

`cd SimpleJavaGames`

Once this is done, to make the program running as seamless as possible, please ensure that you are in the SimpleJavaGames folder. Once you are there, you can run the following commands, which will load the game:

`javac GameLauncher.java`

`java GameLauncher`

You will be prompted for input until you enter a valid command - either to play a game (e.g. T for Tic Tac Toe, or Q for quit)

# Disclaimer
More games will be added to expand the game repository in the future :)
